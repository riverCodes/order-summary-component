## My process

* I started off with the HTML, getting the overall structure of my content correct. I tried to think about how I could make my code accessible as well during this stage.
* Then, i started off with CSS, trying to get the elements in their correct layout. I was working in PC dimensions, not really thinking about responsiveness at this stage.
* Next, I began styling the individual look of the elements. Colors, font sizes, etc.
* Finally, I styled the active states and the project was done. 
* Throughout the project, I struggled with responsiveness, specifically for mobile screens. I don't understand what I am supposed to do.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Will update once I have cleared my doubts.

### Continued development

- I want to understand responsiveness properly.
